# GSM_Based_Prepaid_Electricity_Meter

This project presents the design and implementation of a GSM-based prepaid electricity meter, a smart and efficient alternative to traditional postpaid billing systems. The primary objective is to empower electricity consumers with real-time monitoring and control of their energy usage while enabling utility providers to streamline revenue collection and reduce losses due to billing errors and electricity theft.

The system integrates a digital energy meter with a microcontroller that continuously monitors power consumption and deducts the corresponding units from a prepaid balance. A GSM module is used to enable wireless communication, allowing the system to send SMS alerts for low balance notifications and receive recharge codes remotely. Once the balance is exhausted, the system automatically disconnects the power supply using a relay mechanism, and reconnects it after a successful recharge.

An LCD display provides a user-friendly interface showing the current balance and energy usage. The project offers significant advantages such as remote balance top-up, automated power control, enhanced transparency, and improved energy conservation. This prepaid system is especially useful in households, apartments, hostels, and rural areas where manual billing is impractical or inefficient.

Overall, the GSM-based prepaid electricity meter is a practical and scalable solution for modern energy management, ensuring convenience, accountability, and operational efficiency for both consumers and energy providers.
